				<dial id="Explanation">
				<sent>This visual novel is suposed to be done only by [color=green]Godot's Control nodes [/color] and [color=red]custom c# code[/color].</sent>
				<sent>First, I have an [color=blue]XML[/color] with the text needed. This ways is easy to write the contents, think about the story and write translations.</sent>
				<sent>Then, I have a [color=green]Behaviour Tree[/color] to control the flow. With this, I can create a looooot of scenes that are the little parts of the VN.</sent>
				<sent>For the text, I have the Display system. As I use a custom Entity-Component-System aproximation, the [color=green] Behaviour Tree[/color] nor it's nodes has to worry about it.</sent>
				<sent>So, this intro Scene has 3 [color=green]behaviour tree nodes[/color], 1 for the previous text, 1 for this text and the next for changing the scene.</sent>					
				<sent>And now, I'll change the scene with new nodes, new text!</sent>
